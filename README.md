Catalog Assignment

Steps the Program Takes:
a) Read the JSON Input:
  1) The program receives input in JSON format, which contains some information (like the number of points n and the minimum points needed k).
  2) Each point in the JSON consists of:
   2.1) A number (which is the x value, or position of the point).
   2.2) A base (which tells us how the y value is encoded).
   2.3) A value (the actual encoded y value).
b) Convert the Encoded Values:
  1) The y values are not in normal decimal (base 10), so the program converts them to base 10 using the provided base. For example:
   1.1) If the value is "111" in base 2, it will be converted to 7 in base 10.
   1.2) If the value is "213" in base 4, it will be converted to 39 in base 10.
  2) This gives us pairs of x and y values like (1, 4), (2, 7), etc.
c) Use Lagrange Interpolation:
  1) Once the program has the x and y pairs, it uses Lagrange interpolation, a mathematical formula, to calculate the constant term of the polynomial.
  2) Lagrange interpolation helps us find the polynomialâ€™s value at any point using several given points. In this case, we want to find the value at x = 0, which gives us the constant term (i.e., f(0)).
d) Print the Result:
  1) After calculating the constant term using interpolation, the program prints the result, which is the secret.
